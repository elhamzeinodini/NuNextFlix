1. ```<NuxtLink />``` vs ```a``` :

- ```NuxtLink``` uses ```Vue Router``` under the hood, handles the navigation on ```client side```, avoiding a full page reload, automatically prefetches the content of the next page if it is internal, built in accessibility handler

- use a tag for navigating to a external link or are dealing with a downloadable file
